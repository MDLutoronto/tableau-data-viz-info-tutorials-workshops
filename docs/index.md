# Data Visualization and Tableau: Information, Tutorials, and Workshops

Data Visualization is a broad term that basically involves anything that uses graphical or pictorial representations of data for exploration, sense\-making, and communication. Data visualization allows you and your audience to identify patterns, trends, exceptions, and relationships. It has broad applicability from conveying abstract concepts or ideas to highly complex scientific data.

This page will highlight the resources we offer on data visualization and using Tableau. Tableau is a commercial program used to create data visualizations and interactive dashboards.

Getting started
---------------

* Everyone can get the free version of Tableau, [Tableau Public](https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download) (Note: All the courses/workshops/tutorials were designed for Tableau Desktop, the paid version of Tableau, which used to be available to students; however, now only Tableau Public is available. Tableau Public is very similar to Tableau Desktop and so the resources are still applicable. Notes on the differences will be found throughout the resources.)
